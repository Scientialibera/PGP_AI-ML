# Post Graduate Program AI/Machine Learning Business Applications
Repository featuring some of the projects I made throughout my Post Graduate Diploma. Started with simple statistical analysis and tests and moved on to more complex issues such as natural language processing and stock price prediction with LSMTN's. I will also be adding projects pertaining to Big Data and AI on the Cloud.
